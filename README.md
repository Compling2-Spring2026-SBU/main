## Class Log

### Tue 27 Jan 2026

- Today we introduced the course and went over the syllabus.
- For Thursday:
  - Please make sure you have a github account set up and send me your
	username so I can add you to the "Compling2-Spring2026-SBU" github
	organization.
  - Install Haskell using GHCup. [Instructions are
	here.](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) If you need assistance,
	please let us know asap. Windows users may want to install the
	[Windows Subsystem for
	Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or set up a
	[Virtual Machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with a Linux
	distribution (such as Ubuntu) running on it. [Instructions for how
	to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine are
	here.](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)
 - How do you know if you were able to install Haskell successfully?
 Open a terminal window, and at the command line, do the following.
	```
	$ ghci
	GHCi, version 9.2.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
	ghci> take 5 [1 .. ]
	[1,2,3,4,5]
	ghci>
	```
